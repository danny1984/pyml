# Preface

This project is totally a hobby project used for learning and excising Deep Learning.
To be a freshman in Python, this project also be used to practise python.
Thus, it may be not well organized and sophisticated in coding.
Sorry about that.

If you have any suggestions, pls feel free to connect me.

# Functions

1. Fully connected layer
2. Convolutional neuron networks - still in debug

# Acknowledgement

My first thank should go to my wife, Junhua Shi. 
This work takes me much spare time. And she provides her great comprehension and concern to me.
She contributes much to my precious life.
